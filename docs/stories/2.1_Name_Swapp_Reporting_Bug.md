I've analyzed the documentation and code thoroughly, and I found the issue! 

## The Problem

You're right that name swap matches should be found - and they actually ARE being detected correctly by the core logic. However, there's a **reporting bug** in `run_optimized_analysis.py` that's causing the incorrect statistics.

## Root Cause

In `run_optimized_analysis.py` (lines ~116-118), the match type breakdown code is:

```python
exact = sum(1 for m in matches if m.match_type == 'exact')
fuzzy_normal = sum(1 for m in matches if m.match_type == 'fuzzy_normal')
fuzzy_swapped = sum(1 for m in matches if m.match_type == 'fuzzy_swapped')
```

But the actual match types being generated by the core code are:
- `exact_normal` ✓
- `exact_swapped` ✓  
- `fuzzy_normal` ✓
- `fuzzy_swapped` ✓

The code is checking for `'exact'` which doesn't exist - it should check for both `'exact_normal'` AND `'exact_swapped'` separately!

## Evidence

1. **The core logic is correct**: `duplicate_checker_optimized.py` lines 266-307 properly detect both `exact_normal` and `exact_swapped` matches
2. **The tests pass**: `test_restored_logic.py` shows all 10/10 tests passing, including the exact_swapped test
3. **The export works**: The CSV export would contain the correct match_type values

## The Fix

Update the match type breakdown in `run_optimized_analysis.py` to:

```python
exact_normal = sum(1 for m in matches if m.match_type == 'exact_normal')
exact_swapped = sum(1 for m in matches if m.match_type == 'exact_swapped')
fuzzy_normal = sum(1 for m in matches if m.match_type == 'fuzzy_normal')
fuzzy_swapped = sum(1 for m in matches if m.match_type == 'fuzzy_swapped')
```

And update the display to show all 4 categories properly.

Would you like me to fix this reporting bug? If so, please **toggle to Act mode** and I'll update the `run_optimized_analysis.py` file to correctly display all match types including the name swap detections.
